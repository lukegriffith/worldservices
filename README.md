# training sets 

Use training sets as chromosones. The model gets trained on the packages in the chromosones. They propogate through matching. i.e. see neural.go line 37. Treat as a training pack and have different ones represent a chromosone. 


# training

instead of providing training data, run a simulation on randomaised network weights and propagate the weights through fitness and simulation. the simulation can have an optimul win condition to consider entities to be bred.
