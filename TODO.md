- [x] debugging why network output is always the same. 
    - [x] need to create tests for Grid.GetObjectSenseData to validate its working as expected. 
- [x] ADD AN OSCILATION (Implemented, needs testing)
- ~~[ ] Add ID's to creatures to enable recall from array so debug index can be set correctly when clicked.~~
- [X] Add a different speed in stats and move further distance with it. 
- [ ] Pre-Compute a certain amount of steps per simulation, and have the server export each frame of each cycle. 
    - This moves from having the javascript client call cylce, and having the server get overwhealemd with the requests.
    - Client will be consuming pre-computed simulations, that are pre-made in advance. 
- [ ] Evolutionary experiments 
    - Ability to select what ones can breed and spread behaviours. 
        - Spike: can I acces / change weights of the network.
